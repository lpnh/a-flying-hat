A Web App template leveraging [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) + [askama](https://github.com/djc/askama) + [htmx](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx) and [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss).

## Setup

### Tailwind (standalone CLI)

Get the [latest release](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest) and give it executable permissions:

```no_rust
curl -LO https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64
chmod +x tailwindcss-linux-x64
mv tailwindcss-linux-x64 tailwindcss
```

The `tailwind.config.js` file can be generated by running:

```no_rust
./tailwindcss init
```

### htmx

Simply copy htmx into your project.

Get the file from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/htmx.org/dist/htmx.min.js)

Or simply run:

```no_rust
curl -L https://unpkg.com/htmx.org/dist/htmx.min.js -o htmx.min.js
```
